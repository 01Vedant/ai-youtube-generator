# How to generate your first devotional video (For non-technical users)

This short guide helps a non-technical user (for example: your girlfriend's mother) create a devotional video in minutes.

1. Start the platform locally

   - Open a terminal and run:

   ```powershell
   cd platform
   docker compose up --build
   ```

   - Wait for services to start. Backend will be at `http://localhost:8000`, frontend at `http://localhost:3000`.

2. Open the Dashboard

   - Point your browser to `http://localhost:3000`.
   - Click `Register` and create an account. (We keep this process simple.)

3. Create a Story

   - Click `Create Story`.
   - Enter a title (e.g. `Prahlad Bhakt`) and an optional short description.
   - Click `Generate Story`.

   The system will:
   - Split the story into scenes
   - Generate 4K devotional images automatically
   - Generate high-quality Hindi voiceover using ElevenLabs
   - Create subtitles
   - Stitch the final 4K video

4. Track Progress

   - After submitting, you will receive a `job_id`. Use the `Jobs` view to track progress.
   - Image generation and TTS may take several minutes per scene depending on your keys and internet speed.

5. Preview and Download

   - Use `Preview` to view any scene's image or audio while generation proceeds.
   - When rendering completes, click `Download Video` to save the MP4.

## Frontend: Create Story UI (for first-time users)

The frontend provides multiple entry points for creating a story:

1. **Dashboard**: From the home page, click the prominent **✨ Create Story** button in the header (warm amber accent).
2. **Sidebar**: Click **✨ Create Story** under the "Create" section in the left Sidebar.
3. **Direct link**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/create-story`.

Once you start a story:
- Fill the `Title` field (required) and optionally add a short description or paste the full story text.
- Click **Start Story** to queue a new job.
- The UI will show:
   - A progress bar and percent complete
   - Per-scene previews: a thumbnail image and a small audio player (placeholders appear until real assets are available)
   - Estimated duration per scene
   - A **Download Final Video** button when the job completes


Placeholders:
- The frontend includes safe placeholder assets in `platform/frontend/public/static/placeholders/` (a 4K SVG/PNG). These allow previews to render even when external API keys are not configured.
- The UI also includes an embedded silent MP3 fallback (inlined) so the audio player always has a playable source during safe testing. Placeholders and embedded fallbacks are automatically replaced in the UI when real images and audio are generated by the backend.
