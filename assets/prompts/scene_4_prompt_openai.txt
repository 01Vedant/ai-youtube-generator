Illustrate Hiranyakashipu raging in a private chamber, pointing angrily at Prahlad. Scene montage suggestion: clips/frames of failed punishments — a teacher scolding, wild elephants held back, venomous snakes coiling but stopping, ministers looking worried. Prahlad stands calm with glowing aura. Style: cinematic montage panels, semi-realistic, Indian miniature inset frames, vibrant colors, devotional aura. Animation potential: quick cross-dissolve montage, slight shake during angry beats, glowing shield around Prahlad. --ar 16:9 --quality cinematic --vibrant --ultra-detailed --4k
