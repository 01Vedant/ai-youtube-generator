Depict Hiranyakashipu as a towering, proud rakshasa-king in an ornate golden palace hall, heavy jeweled armor, mace at his side, face furious yet regal. Courtiers cower in background. Architecture: ancient Indian palace with carved pillars, murals, incense smoke. Lighting: dramatic side-lighting, deep shadows, cinematic contrast. Style: semi-realistic Indian mythological painting, Pahari miniature touches, high detail. Animation potential: cloth banners sway, incense smoke drifting, subtle camera push-in. | cinematic lighting | highly detailed | 4k | semi-realistic | animation-ready
