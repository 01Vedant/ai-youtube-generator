Use as 3D background plate: high-res 4k image, layers for FG/MG/BG, normal map and alpha for cloth/aura. Create a dramatic night scene: Holika (sister of Hiranyakashipu) sits confidently on a pyre wearing a fire-resistant cloak, Prahlad seated beside her or standing protected. Holika: regal, dark saree, confident expression; Prahlad: small, calm, peaceful. Environment: open courtyard with tall flames around, villagers and guards watching in shock. Lighting: roaring fire warm light, sparks flying, cinematic contrast. Style: Indian mythological art, semi-realistic, high detail. Animation potential: dynamic flames, sparks, flickering cloak (Holika's cloak should appear to fail subtly), particles.
