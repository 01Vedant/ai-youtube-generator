Show the climax: Holika's cloak burning and failing, Holika collapsing, Prahlad standing unharmed and glowing with divine light. Close-ups of Prahlad's uplifted face, a soft halo around him, embers floating. Background: shocked onlookers, flames receding near Prahlad. Style: cinematic, devotional, semi-realistic with painterly brushstrokes reminiscent of Raja Ravi Varma. Animation potential: cloak catching fire and disintegrating, glowing light expanding from Prahlad, slow-mo embers. --ar 16:9 --quality cinematic --vibrant --ultra-detailed --4k
