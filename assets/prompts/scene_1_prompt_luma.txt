Use as 3D background plate: high-res 4k image, layers for FG/MG/BG, normal map and alpha for cloth/aura. Create a highly detailed cinematic portrait shot of a warm Indian female host (Arti) in a simple devotional studio set: soft marigold garlands, small brass diya on a wooden table, soft bokeh temple-lamp background. She wears a simple saree (saffron/vermillion border), light kumkum on forehead, gentle smile, folded hands. Lighting: golden rim light, devotional aura, subtle particle dust motes. Style: semi-realistic, Indian devotional art with Raja Ravi Varma brush influences, cinematic lighting, 4k, high detail. Animation potential: slow subtle head nod, gentle breathing, flicker of diya flame, drifting prayer-particle dust.
